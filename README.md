Communication Project -Intelligent-Traffic-Debugger-Using-P4
In collaboration with Mellanox, I participated in a project using Mellanox
SN3700 P4-capable Spectrum-2 based switches and implemented an online
intelligent method, based on postcard telemetry, that has analyzed end-to end traffic congestion or high latency events and provided information
helpful to pinpoint its root cause of the congestion.
Main programming languages are P4 and python, including building a user GUI
